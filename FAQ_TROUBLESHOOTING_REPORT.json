  "conclusion": "The FAQ section issue appears to be a complex interaction between CSS specificity, JavaScript timing, and potentially browser caching. Despite multiple comprehensive fix attempts, the core issue of answers not appearing when questions are clicked persists. The recommended approach is to isolate the CSS loading and application, potentially using a more direct JavaScript-only solution or ensuring CSS is properly loaded before JavaScript executes."
